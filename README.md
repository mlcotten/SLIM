# SLIM
SLIM is a python script written by Matthew Cotten for sorting virus encoding nucleic acids based on a rapid ublast search of virus protein databases. The method was developed for sorting sequence contigs after de novo assembly of short read data from viral samples. The method is simple to implement, rapid and outputs fasta files of the identified contigs in the correct orientation, with the hit information included in the fasta ID and in the correct orientation.
